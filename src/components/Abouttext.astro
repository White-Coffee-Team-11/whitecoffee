  <h2>WHO ARE WE?</h2>
  <p>We started White Coffee in Århus because we couldn’t find clothes that felt like us.</p>
  <p>Everything was loud, fast, overdesigned. And we wanted the opposite — something calm, honest, and easy to wear.</p>
  <p>To us, White Coffee isn’t just a brand. It’s a way of choosing presence over pressure.</p>
  <p>Our collections are built on soft tones, subtle details, and everyday pieces that don’t try too hard — but still feel like something.</p>
  <p>We’re inspired by early mornings, slow routines, and that first quiet moment before the day begins.</p>
  <p>That’s where the name comes from, too.</p>
  <p>White Coffee is our pace — and maybe it’s yours too.</p>
